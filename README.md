# Visual Particle Simulator
This program recreates interactions between particles(red) and drains(green). They interact via gravitational attraction, and change their trajectories accordingly. <br>
The small, blue arrows(generators) randomly generate particles with an initial velocity and mass. <br>
As time progresses, the various gravitational interactions change the velocity of the particles, causing them to speed up(bright red) or slow down(dark red). <br>
Once a particle touches the center of a sink, it gets deleted from the simulation.
